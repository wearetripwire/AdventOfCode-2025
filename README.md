# Advent of Code (Team Repository)

## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code (AoC) is an annual set of programming puzzles released daily from December 1st through December 25th. Each day includes two parts that ramp in complexity, and can be solved in any language.

## How we’ll approach solutions

We’ll use a lightweight workflow that encourages small, reviewable changes:

- **Directory structure**
  Create a directory under your name for each day (e.g. `brian/day1`).

- **Branching**
  Create a branch for each part of each day (e.g. `brian/day1/part1`).

- **Pull requests**
  Create a pull request for each part:
  - Part 1 targets `main`.
  - Part 2 targets the Part 1 branch.
